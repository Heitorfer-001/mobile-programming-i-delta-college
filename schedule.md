**Topic**: Introduction to React Native  

**Homework**:  
Based on the "Add task" app. 

Add a new functionality called `Add activity`. In order to accomplish this, do the following:
- Add a new `textInput`
- Add a new `Button`
- Add a new `FlatList`
- Implement the flow among them

The previous 3 components are related to the `Activity` functionality. 

Keep in mind that the `Task` functionality CANNOT BE DELETED.

| States            | It is a built-in object that allows components to store, manage, and react to dynamic data changes, triggering re-renders when updated.           |
| Props                       | They are read-only inputs passed from a parent component to a child component, allowing data and event handlers to be shared between components.                     |
| Events      | They are user interactions (e.g., touches, gestures, text input) handled using built-in event props like onPress, onChangeText, and onScroll, often combined with gesture responders for a mobile-friendly experience.                             |
| UseState hook     | The useState hook is used to manage state within functional components, allowing components to store and update values dynamically, triggering re-renders when the state changes.  |
